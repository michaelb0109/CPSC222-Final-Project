CPSC222 Quantified Self: Final Project

This project uses health data that was automatically recorded from my iPhone and then exported using an app known as [Health Auto Export](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/health-auto-export-json-csv/id1115567069).

Days of the week were added to this data and then analyzed to see if there was any significant difference in walking patterns based on the day of the week.
